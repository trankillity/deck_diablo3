# Diablo 3 on Deck Readme
This is a guide on how best to use my controller configuration for Diablo 3 on the Steam Deck.

Diablo 3 on console has excellent controls (and some great QOL changes), but Blizzard are yet to bring them over to the PC client. I've spent many hours tinkering with the configuration to get it to a stage of being very close to emulating the console controls.

## Important Diablo 3 settings
* Bind Force Move to Mouse Wheel Down (used for forcing movement and allowing the client to look like those who use the Logitech mouse trick)
* Bind all other keys to default
* Set "Voice" volume to 0 (or you will get many "Not enough rage/mana/hatred" error lines)

## Basic bindings
* Left track pad or joystick for an absolute mouse region around your character
* Touching left track pad will turbo repeat the force move binding
* Moving the left joystick to the outer ring position will turbo repeat force move binding
* Clicking the left joystick will toggle repeat force move binding
* Right trackpad for standard mouse
* AXYB = 1,2,3,4 abilities respectively
* R2 for Left Mouse Button
* R1 for Right Mouse Buton
* L2 for hold position/Shift
* L1 for potion
* "Menu" for Esc/Menu
* "View" for Inventory
* L4/R4 for Alt/Ctrl (both at same time)

## Advanced bindings
* Hold AXYB in order to toggle repeating of these buttons (Equivalent to Numlock trick on PC)

## Recommended skill setup/usage
I find that using the left track pad feels more natural than using the joystick as it's hard to be precise with the joystick, but easy with the trackpad. Both options are there however.
When moving and aiming with the left stick or trackpad, hold the left to force you to stand still when casting any abilities.

Any buffs or cooldown abilities should be bound in your 1-4 slot. If you are at end-game and need these abilities to trigger repeatedly or whenever they are off cooldown, then hold the AXYB buttons for 500ms to toggle re-casting of them every 1s. Just remember you will need to disable this automatic re-casting by toggling the ability again when you try to port back to town.

If you have any channeled skills, they really need to be bound to right trigger or right bumper as a held button because holding any of the face buttons will trigger a repeating press of those buttons rather than holding it.
