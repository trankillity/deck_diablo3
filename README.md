This is a guide on how best to use my controller configuration for Diablo 3 on the Steam Deck.

Diablo 3 on console has excellent controls (and some great QOL changes), but Blizzard are yet to bring them over to the PC client. I've spent many hours tinkering with the configuration to get it to a stage of being very close to emulating the console controls.

## Important Diablo 3 settings
* Bind Force Move to Mouse Wheel Down (used for forcing movement and allowing the client to look like those who use the Logitech mouse trick)
* Bind all other keys to default
* Turn off error sounds

## Basic bindings
* Left track pad for an absolute mouse region around your character to emulate a joytick
* Click left trackpad to enable constant movement towards the cursor
* Right trackpad for standard mouse
* AXYB = 1,2,3,4 abilities respectively
* Right trigger for Left Mouse Button
* Right bumper for Right Mouse Buton
* Left trigger for hold position/Shift
* Left bumper for potion
* Left joystick for radial UI menu
* "Menu" for Esc/Menu
* "View" for Inventory
* L4/R4 for Alt/Ctrl (both at same time)

## Advanced bindings
* Hold AXYB in order to toggle repeating of these buttons (Equivalent to Numlock trick on PC)

## Recommended skill setup/usage
Get used to pressing the left trackpad to toggle movement on or off. Generally for the most part you can leave it on until you need to go to town or do UI/inventory management. Holding the left trigger will force you to stand still when casting any abilities.

Any buffs or cooldown abilities should be bound in your 1-4 slot. If you are at end-game and need these abilities to trigger repeatedly or whenever they are off cooldown, then feel free to use the advanced binding of holding the AXYB buttons to have them re-cast constantly. Just remember you will need to disable this automatic re-casting by toggling the ability again when you try to port back to town.

If you have any channeled skills, they really need to be bound to right trigger or right bumper as a held button because holding any of the face buttons will trigger a repeating press of those buttons rather than holding it.
